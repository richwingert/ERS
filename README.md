# ERS
Employee Reimbursement System

This was a practice application developed during training at Revature.

The Expense Reimbursement System (ERS) will manage the process of reimbursing employees
for expenses incurred while on company time. All employees in the company can login and
submit requests for reimbursement and view their past tickets and pending requests. Finance
managers can log in and view all reimbursement requests and past history for all employees in
the company. Finance managers are authorized to approve and deny requests for expense
reimbursement.
